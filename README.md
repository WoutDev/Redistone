# Redistone
Redistone is a single-proxy core system that can handle a lot of functionality through Redis pub/sub messaging and SQL datastorage. ***This project is still going through a lot of refactoring and is in no way ready for production environments. It's an old project that I've been trying to update and make it work!***
